## About The Task

Environment

This exercise should be solved with Node.js >= 16 and its available features. TypeScript
implementation is preferred over plain JavaScript, but no requirement.
The solution should include the full source code and any script or instruction necessary
for executing/running the app. There are no restrictions regarding used libraries.

Exercise: Political Speeches
The goal of this exercise is to calculate some statistics from given input data about
political speeches. The application should handle CSV files (UTF-8 encoded), structured
as below:

Speaker, Topic, Date, Words
Alexander Abel, Education Policy, 2012-10-30, 5310
Bernhard Belling, Coal Subsidies, 2012-11-05, 1210
Caesare Collins, Coal Subsidies, 2012-11-06, 1119
Alexander Abel, Internal Security, 2012-12-11, 911

The application should provide an HTTP endpoint which accepts one or more given URLs (http and https) via query parameters at the path:

`GET /evaluation?url=url1&url=url2`

The provided CSV files at these URLs should be downloaded, processed and evaluated to answer the following questions:

1.  Which politician gave the most speeches in 2013?

2.  Which politician gave the most speeches on the topic â€žInternal Security"?

3.  Which politician used the fewest words (in total)?

Expected Output:
JSON:
`{ "mostSpeeches": null, "mostSecurity": "Alexander Abel", "leastWordy": "Caesare Collins" }`

(for unambiguous solution the result for this field should be null)
